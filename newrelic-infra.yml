#
# New Relic infrastructure agent configuration file
#
# This file overrides the agent defaults. Lines that begin with # are comments,
# which are ignored by the infrastructure agent. Uncomment the desired options
# to enable them. Restart the agent or the server after changing settings.
#
# To use this file, change its name to newrelic-infra.yml and move it to:
#    - Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra.yml
#    - Windows: C:\Program Files\New Relic\newrelic-infra\newrelic-infra.yml
#
# The infrastructure agent only requires the license key to be
# configured; the rest of the default values represent best practices.
#
# If options have command line equivalents, New Relic uses the command line
# options to override values set in this file.
#
# Environment variables (documented here as "Env var") always override the
# values set in the configuration file. We recommend setting any sensitive
# information through environment variables.
#
# For more information on each setting, see https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-manage-infrastructure/configuration/infrastructure-configuration-settings

# Value  : 40-character hexadecimal string provided by New Relic. This is the
#          only required value in your config file.
